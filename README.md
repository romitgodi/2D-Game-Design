This game is a novice attempt to remake a part of the original Contra developed and published by Konami and which was released as a home version for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
The goal is to reach the end of the world by avoiding the menacing fireballs falling from the heavens. The player can shoot these fireballs to make way for itself.
At the end, the player has to fight the enemy who has been designed with AI. The enemy knows the position of the player and switches it's own position on being fired upon by the contra player.
The game will restart when either the player defeats the enemy or gets killed by the enemy or the fireballs.
